2D Game Experiment with Python and pyGame.

I am building this game with my 5 year old son.  He gets to dictate the overall look and feel of the game.  We'll see how it goes...

Notes

This project uses pyGame (http://www.pygame.org/) as well as Pyganim (http://inventwithpython.com/pyganim/index.html).
Currently all artwork is provided by the excellent SpriteLib (http://www.widgetworx.com/widgetworx/portfolio/spritelib.html)
